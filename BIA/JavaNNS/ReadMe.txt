                              ReadMe File


Welcome to JavaNNS, the successor of SNNS. Since you are reading this
file, you have obviously managed to unpack the program. In order to
install it, follow the steps described in the JavaNNS User Manual,
which is placed in the directory "manual". The User Manual is provided
as a PDF file and as a set of HTML files, starting with
JavaNNS-manual.html.

The installation is very easy and takes only several seconds, provided
that you have a Java Runtime Environment installed. In order to use
JavaNNS, you have to make sure that the computing kernel - i.e.
SNNS_jkr.dll for Windows and libSNNS_jkr.so for Unix - is available.
The kernel (the library) will be installed when you run the program
for the first time. You can start the program by typing

  java -jar JavaNNS.jar
  
from the command prompt.

In order to be able to use the User Manual from within the simulator,
you may have to adjust one or two of the JavaNNS properties:
  1. Browser name
  2. User manual URL
You can adjust them by choosing Properties... from View menu in JavaNNS.
All properties have default values and you are free to change them.
Please refer to the User Manual for details.
