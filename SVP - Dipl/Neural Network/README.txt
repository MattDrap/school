This is the code that was used in the publication "Classification and Segmentation of Satellite Orthoimagery using Convolutional Neural Networks" by Martin LÃ¤ngkvist, Andrey Kiselev, Marjan Alirezaie and Amy Loutfi.

Since the map in the paper is too large and protected, this demo shows how the code works for the task of performing per-pixel classification, classification clean-up, and region merging of an outdoor image instead. 

To run, start matlab, cd to the path where this readme file is located, and run the file "RunCNN.m"

The code was tested on both Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 7 64-bit with MATLAB R2012a and 16 GB RAM.
