TODO
. Improve documentation. 
. Make custom toolbar buttons can assume a "pressed" state (useful to last buttons). Solved Issue 128 in scite-ru.
. Update source based on lastest SciTE version.
. Make the "stop executing" really stop glpsol (and not only cmd.exe) when called extra commands like build LP and Build MPS commands.
. Test PyMatProg under SciTE
. Scite and Gusek (or even glpk/scite) use the same user options file (SciTEUser.properties), need to be renamed
. Make a installer to users that do not want/need/undestand portable apps =)
